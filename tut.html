<h5 styule="color: #DD7106"><b>About the Topic: </b></h5>								
<p align="justify"> 
This presentation gives a perspective on how tsunami of data is currently hitting the enterprise datacenter from edge to cloud and how an AI plays an important role as a key enabler for efficient infrastructure operations. The growing scale of data fuels a need for better and efficient infrastructure, starting at the Edge and spanning across core/cloud. This brings an enormous opportunity as well as challenges for enterprises data centers, be at edge or core. AI plays a key role in ensuring optimal performance and maintenance of infrastructure which leads to reduced downtime and maximum efficiency. Machine learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, is expected to optimize every facet of data center operations, including planning and design, managing application workloads. This in turn would improvise both CAPEX and OPEX for the enterprise customers.
