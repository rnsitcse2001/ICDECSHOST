<!--                                        <p>In this tutorial, recent advances and emerging topics on robust statistical methods for signal processing are presented. A signal processing procedure is statistically robust if it is not sensitive to departures from the assumed signal and noise models. The goal of a signal processing practitioner is then to design robust procedures that give a close to optimal performance at the nominal models and a highly reliable performance even in the worst case scenarios. We will provide a brief overview of basic concepts and tools needed in developing and analyzing robust methods. These tools facilitate devising signal processing techniques that are provably robust, and establishing their statistical properties. Examples illustrating these basic concepts are given in multivariate settings encountered in sensor array and multichannel signal processing. A commonly used assumption in signal processing is that observations are independent and identically distributed. Recent advances in robust statistical techniques for dependent data are presented. Applications, for example, in estimating the state of the power grid and the processing of time series data are provided. Statistically robust methods for processing large scale data (Big Data) are described as well.  The volume and dimensionality of the data may be so high that it cannot be processed or stored in a single computing node. We describe a scalable, statistically robust and computationally efficient bootstrap method that is compatible with distributed processing and storage systems. Finally, statistically robust methods for processing sparse tensor-valued data are described with practical signal processing examples.</p>-->

<!--                                        <p>During the past 15 years there has been a tremendous amount of work on communication- and/or energy-efficient methods for distributed signal processing. The aim of this tutorial is to provide and introduction and overview to state-of-the-art methods for decentralized estimation and tracking using gossip algorithms. We will begin with a review gossip algorithms for distributed averaging, focusing in particular on the push-sum and broadcast gossip algorithms which are especially attractive for use in wireless networks. Then we will discuss distributed particle filtering methods for estimation and tracking. We will highlight methods that have been developed during the past five years for reducing the communication overhead in the context of distributed particle filtering. A major challenge in the distributed setting is to fuse information contained in the measurements gathered at each sensor in a communication-efficient manner (i.e., without simply flooding all measurements over the network). We will discuss a variety of methods for approximating either the joint log likelihood function of the observations from all sensors, or for approximating the posterior distribution of the target state given all of the sensors’ observations. Finally, we will present recent results on error bounds for distributed particle filters. Throughout, as running examples, we will consider the problems of tracking an underwater target target using a network of bearings-only sensors and tracking targets using signal strength measurements. We will conclude with a discussion of open problems and potential directions for future work.</p>-->
